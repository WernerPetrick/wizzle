      <p>
        Thank you so much for signing up — I’m genuinely thrilled to have you here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wizzle started as a small side project to solve a real problem in my own life, and it means a lot to me that you're now part of this journey. My hope is that Wizzle makes sharing your wishes easier, smoother, and a little more joyful.
      </p>

      <p>
        You’re one of the very first people to try this out, and your feedback, ideas, and even bug reports will help shape where it goes from here. Seriously — I’d love to hear from you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you ever get stuck, have a question, or just want to say hi, I’m only an email away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks again for joining — and happy wishing
      </p>
