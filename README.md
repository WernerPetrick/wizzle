# Wizzle

[!NOTE]
As part of a challenge, this project was entirely vibe coded using Github Copilot and Builder.io

Wizzle is a social wishlist web application built with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to create wishlists, share them with friends, ask and answer questions about wishlist items, and track gift history. The app supports friend invitations (including inviting non-users), notifications, and inline editing for a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Wishlists:** Create, edit, and delete wishlists and wishlist items.
- **Sharing:** Share wishlists with friends via email invitations.
- **Friends:** Invite friends (users and non-users), accept/decline invitations, and manage your friends list.
- **Questions & Notes:** Ask anonymous questions about wishlist items; owners can reply and both parties are notified via email.
- **Gift History:** Track gifts youâ€™ve bought for friends.
- **Email Integration:** Email notifications for invitations and questions using [letter_opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) in development..
